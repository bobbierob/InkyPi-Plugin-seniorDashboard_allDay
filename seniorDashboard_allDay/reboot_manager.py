"""Process-scoped reboot scheduler for the Senior Dashboard plugin.

When the device loses its network connection the dashboard cannot update. Power-save on the
Pi/router occasionally kills the WLAN until the device is rebooted, so the plugin schedules a
delayed reboot to recover automatically. This module holds the scheduling state (a single
``threading.Timer``) so it survives across ``generate_image()`` calls within the same process.

The reboot uses ``os.system("sudo reboot")`` -- the same mechanism the core ``settings.py``
``/shutdown`` endpoint uses, relying on the already-configured passwordless sudo.
